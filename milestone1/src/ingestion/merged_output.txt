accordance with the conditions prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
Closely connected facts
4.Facts which, though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in issue or a
relevant fact as to form part of the same transaction, are relevant, whether they occurred at
the same time and place or at different times and places.
Illustrations.
(a) A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. Whatever was said or done by A
or B or the bystanders at the beating, or so shortly before or after it as to form part of the
transaction, is a relevant fact.
(b) A is accused of waging war against the Government of India by taking part in an
armed insurrection in which property is destroyed, troops are attacked and jails are broken
open. The occurrence of these facts is relevant, as forming part of the general transaction,
though A may not have been present at all of them.
(c) A sues B for a libel contained in a letter forming part of a correspondence. Letters
between the parties relating to the subject out of which the libel arose, and forming part of
the correspondence in which it is contained, are relevant facts, though they do not contain
the libel itself.
(d) The question is, whether certain goods ordered from B were delivered to A. The
goods were delivered to several intermediate persons successively. Each delivery is a
relevant fact.
5.Facts which are the occasion, cause or effect, immediate or otherwise, of relevant
facts, or facts in issue, or which constitute the state of things under which they happened,
or which afforded an opportunity for their occurrence or transaction, are relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A robbed B. The facts that, shortly before the robbery,
B went to a fair with money in his possession, and that he showed it, or mentioned the fact
that he had it, to third persons, are relevant.

struggle at or near the place where the murder was committed, are relevant facts.

4 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y [Part II—_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(2) The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit or proceeding,
in reference to such suit or proceeding, or in reference to any fact in issue therein or relevant
thereto, and the conduct of any person, an offence against whom is the subject of any
proceeding, is relevant, if such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or
relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent thereto.
Explanation1.—The word "conduct" in this section does not include statements,
unless those statements accompany and explain acts other than statements; but this
explanation is not to affect the relevancy of statements under any other section of this
Adhiniyam.
Explanation2.—When the conduct of any person is relevant, any statement made to
him or in his presence and hearing, which affects such conduct, is relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) Ais tried for the murder of B. The facts thatA murdered C, that B knew that A had
murdered C, and that B had tried to extort money fromA by threatening to make his knowledge
public, are relevant.
(b) A sues B upon a bond for the payment of money. B denies the making of the
bond. The fact that, at the time when the bond was alleged to be made, B required money for
a particular purpose, is relevant.
(c) A is tried for the murder of B by poison. The fact that, before the death of B, A
procured poison similar to that which was administered to B, is relevant.
(d) The question is, whether a certain document is the will of A. The facts that, not
long before, the date of the alleged will, A made inquiry into matters to which the provisions
of the alleged will relate; that he consulted advocates in reference to making the will, and
that he caused drafts of other wills to be prepared, of which he did not approve, are relevant.
(e) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the
alleged crime, A provided evidence which would tend to give to the facts of the case an
appearance favourable to himself, or that he destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented
the presence or procured the absence of persons who might have been witnesses, or
suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are relevant.
(f) The question is, whether A robbed B. The facts that, after B was robbed, C said in
A's presence—"the police are coming to look for the person who robbed B", and that
immediately afterwardsA ran away, are relevant.
(g) The question is, whether A owes B ten thousand rupees. The facts that A asked
C to lend him money, and that D said to C in A's presence and hearing—"I advise you not
to trust A, for he owes B ten thousand rupees", and that A went away without making any
answer, are relevant facts.
(h) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The fact that A absconded, after
receiving a letter, warning A that inquiry was being made for the criminal, and the contents
of the letter, are relevant.
(i) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, after the commission of the alleged crime,
A absconded, or was in possession of property or the proceeds of property acquired by the
crime, or attempted to conceal things which were or might have been used in committing it,
are relevant.
(j) The question is, whetherA was raped. The fact that, shortly after the alleged rape,
A made a complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in
which, the complaint was made, are relevant. The fact that, without making a complaint, A
said that A had been raped is not relevant as conduct under this section, though it may be
relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) of section 26, or as corroborative evidence
under section 160.
Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y 5_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(k) The question is, whether A was robbed. The fact that, soon after the alleged
robbery, A made a complaint relating to the offence, the circumstances under which, and the
terms in which, the complaint was made, are relevant. The fact that A said he had been
robbed, without making any complaint, is not relevant, as conduct under this section,
though it may be relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) of section 26, or as
corroborative evidence under section 160.
7.Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which
support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or a relevant fact, or which
establish the identity of anything, or person whose identity, is relevant, or fix the time or
place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or which show the relation of
parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are necessary
for that purpose.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether a given document is the will of A. The state of A's
property and of his family at the date of the alleged will may be relevant facts.
(b) A sues B for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to A; B affirms that the matter
alleged to be libellous is true. The position and relations of the parties at the time when the
libel was published may be relevant facts as introductory to the facts in issue. The particulars
of a dispute between Aand B about a matter unconnected with the alleged libel are irrelevant,
though the fact that there was a dispute may be relevant if it affected the relations between
A and B.
(c) A is accused of a crime. The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A
absconded from his house, is relevant under section 6, as conduct subsequent to and
affected by facts in issue. The fact that, at the time when he left home, A had sudden and
urgent business at the place to which he went, is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that
he left home suddenly. The details of the business on which he left are not relevant, except
in so far as they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and urgent.
(d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him with A. C, on
leaving A's service, says to A—"I am leaving you because B has made me a better offer".
This statement is a relevant fact as explanatory of C's conduct, which is relevant as a fact in
issue.
(e) A, accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to B, who is seen to give it
to A's wife. B says as he delivers it—"A says you are to hide this". B's statement is relevant
as explanatory of a fact which is part of the transaction.
(f) Ais tried for a riot and is proved to have marched at the head of a mob. The cries of
the mob are relevant as explanatory of the nature of the transaction.
8.Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have
conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done or
written by any one of such persons in reference to their common intention, after the time
when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against
each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the
existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party
to it.
Illustration.
Reasonable ground exists for believing that A has joined in a conspiracy to wage war
against the State.
The facts that B procured arms in Europe for the purpose of the conspiracy, C collected
money in Kolkata for a like object, D persuaded persons to join the conspiracy in Mumbai,
E published writings advocating the object in view at Agra, and F transmitted from Delhi to

G at Singapore the money which C had collected at Kolkata, and the contents of a letter
written by H giving an account of the conspiracy, are each relevant, both to prove the
existence of the conspiracy, and to prove A's complicity in it, although he may have been
ignorant of all of them, and although the persons by whom they were done were strangers
to him, and although they may have taken place before he joined the conspiracy or after he
left it.
9.Facts not otherwise relevant are relevant—
(1) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact;
(2) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or
non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable or improbable.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A committed a crime at Chennai on a certain day.
The fact that, on that day, A was at Ladakh is relevant. The fact that, near the time
when the crime was committed, A was at a distance from the place where it was
committed, which would render it highly improbable, though not impossible, that he
committed it, is relevant.
(b) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The circumstances are such
that the crime must have been committed either by A, B, C or D. Every fact which
shows that the crime could have been committed by no one else, and that it was not
committed by either B, C or D, is relevant.
10.In suits in which damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the Court to
determine the amount of damages which ought to be awarded, is relevant.
11.Where the question is as to the existence of any right or custom, the following
facts are relevant—
(a) any transaction by which the right or custom in question was created,
claimed, modified, recognised, asserted or denied, or which was inconsistent with its
existence;
(b) particular instances in which the right or custom was claimed, recognised
or exercised, or in which its exercise was disputed, asserted or departed from.
Illustration.
The question is, whether A has a right to a fishery. A deed conferring the fishery on
A's ancestors, a mortgage of the fishery by A's father, a subsequent grant of the fishery by
A's father, irreconcilable with the mortgage, particular instances in whichA's father exercised
the right, or in which the exercise of the right was stopped by A's neighbours, are relevant
facts.
12.Facts showing the existence of any state of mind, such as intention, knowledge,
good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-will or goodwill towards any particular person, or
showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant, when the existence
of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant.
Explanation1.—A fact relevant as showing the existence of a relevant state of mind
must show that the state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular
matter in question.
Explanation2.—But where, upon the trial of a person accused of an offence, the
previous commission by the accused of an offence is relevant within the meaning of this
section, the previous conviction of such person shall also be a relevant fact.
When facts
not otherwise
relevant
become
relevant.
Facts tending
to enable Court
to determine
amount are
relevant in suits
for damages.
Facts relevant
when right or
custom is in
question.
Facts showing
existence of
state of mind,
or of body or
bodily feeling.
Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y 7_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Illustrations.
(a) Ais accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. It is proved that
he was in possession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same time, he was in
possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each
and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.
(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency
which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. The fact that, at the time
of its delivery, A was possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit currency is
relevant. The fact that A had been previously convicted of delivering to another person as
genuine a counterfeit currency knowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.
(c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious. The fact
that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are
relevant.
(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name
of the payee was fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same
manner before they could have been transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been
a real person, is relevant, as showing that A knew that the payee was a fictitious person.
(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the
reputation of B. The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the
part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the
particular publication in question. The facts that there was no previous quarrel between A
and B, and that A repeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing
that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B.
(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B,
being induced to trust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss. The fact that, at the time when
A represented C to be solvent, C was supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by
persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that A made the representation in good
faith.
(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner,
by the order of C, a contractor. A's defence is that B's contract was with C. The fact that A
paid C for the work in question is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, make over to
C the management of the work in question, so that C was in a position to contract with B on
C's own account, and not as agent for A.
(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found,
and the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real
owner could not be found. The fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been
given in the place where A was, is relevant, as showing that A did not in good faith believe
that the real owner of the property could not be found. The fact that A knew, or had reason
to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of the loss of the
property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A
knew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith.
(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's intent,
the fact of A's having previously shot at B may be proved.
(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously
sent by A to B may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters.
(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife.
Expressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are
relevant facts.
(l) The question is, whether A's death was caused by poison. Statements made by A
during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.
8 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y [Part II—_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(m) The question is, what was the state of A's health at the time when an assurance on
his life was effected. Statements made byA as to the state of his health at or near the time in
question are relevant facts.
(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a car for hire not reasonably fit for
use, whereby A was injured. The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the
defect of that particular car is relevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the
cars which he let to hire is irrelevant.
(o)A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead. The fact that A on
other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B. The fact that A
was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant.
(p) A is tried for a crime. The fact that he said something indicating an intention to
commit that particular crime is relevant. The fact that he said something indicating a general
disposition to commit crimes of that class is irrelevant.
13.When there is a question whether an act was accidental or intentional, or done
with a particular knowledge or intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of
similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was concerned, is relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) A is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is
insured. The facts that A lived in several houses successively each of which he insured, in
each of which a fire occurred, and after each of which fires A received payment from a
different insurance company, are relevant, as tending to show that the fires were not
accidental.
(b) Ais employed to receive money from the debtors of B. It is A's duty to make entries
in a book showing the amounts received by him. He makes an entry showing that on a
particular occasion he received less than he really did receive. The question is, whether this
false entry was accidental or intentional. The facts that other entries made by A in the same
book are false, and that the false entry is in each case in favour of A, are relevant.
(c) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to B a counterfeit currency. The question
is, whether the delivery of the currency was accidental. The facts that, soon before or soon
after the delivery to B, A delivered counterfeit currency to C, D and E are relevant, as
showing that the delivery to B was not accidental.
14.When there is a question whether a particular act was done, the existence of any
course of business, according to which it naturally would have been done, is a relevant fact.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether a particular letter was dispatched. The facts that it was
the ordinary course of business for all letters put in a certain place to be carried to the post,
and that particular letter was put in that place are relevant.
(b) The question is, whether a particular letter reached A. The facts that it was posted
in due course, and was not returned through the Return Letter Office, are relevant.
Admissions
15.An admission is a statement, oral or documentary or contained in electronic form,
which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by
any of the persons, and under the circumstances, hereinafter mentioned.
16.(1) Statements made by a party to the proceeding, or by an agent to any such
party, whom the Court regards, under the circumstances of the case, as expressly or impliedly
authorised by him to make them, are admissions.

(2) Statements made by—
(i) parties to suits suing or sued in a representative character, are not admissions,
unless they were made while the party making them held that character; or
(ii) (a) persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest in the subject
matter of the proceeding, and who make the statement in their character of persons so
interested; or
(b) persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived their interest in the
subject matter of the suit,
are admissions, if they are made during the continuance of the interest of the persons
making the statements.
17.Statements made by persons whose position or liability, it is necessary to prove
as against any party to the suit, are admissions, if such statements would be relevant as
against such persons in relation to such position or liability in a suit brought by or against
them, and if they are made whilst the person making them occupies such position or is
subject to such liability.
Illustration.
A undertakes to collect rents for B. B sues A for not collecting rent due from C to B. A
denies that rent was due from C to B. A statement by C that he owed B rent is an admission,
and is a relevant fact as against A, if A denies that C did owe rent to B.
18.Statements made by persons to whom a party to the suit has expressly referred
for information in reference to a matter in dispute are admissions.
Illustration.
The question is, whether a horse sold by A to B is sound.
A says to B—"Go and ask C, C knows all about it". C's statement is an admission.
19.Admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes
them, or his representative in interest; but they cannot be proved by or on behalf of the
person who makes them or by his representative in interest, except in the following cases,
namely:—
(1) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when
it is of such a nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as
between third persons under section 26;
(2) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when
it consists of a statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in
issue, made at or about the time when such state of mind or body existed, and is
accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood improbable;
(3) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is
relevant otherwise than as an admission.
Illustrations.
(a) The question between A and B is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged. A
affirms that it is genuine, B that it is forged. A may prove a statement by B that the deed is
genuine, and B may prove a statement by A that deed is forged; but A cannot prove a
statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by himself that
the deed is forged.
(b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away. Evidence is given to show
that the ship was taken out of her proper course. A produces a book kept by him in the
ordinary course of his business showing observations alleged to have been taken by him

from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper course. A may
prove these statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were
dead, under clause (b) of section 26.
(c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Kolkata. He produces a letter written
by himself and dated at Chennai on that day, and bearing the Chennai post-mark of that day.
The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead, it would be
admissible under clause (b) of section 26.
(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He offers to
prove that he refused to sell them below their value. A may prove these statements, though
they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue.
(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit currency which
he knew to be counterfeit. He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the
currency as he doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that person did examine it
and told him it was genuine. A may prove these facts.
20.Oral admissions as to the contents of a document are not relevant, unless and
until the party proposing to prove them shows that he is entitled to give secondary evidence
of the contents of such document under the rules hereinafter contained, or unless the
genuineness of a document produced is in question.
21.In civil cases no admission is relevant, if it is made either upon an express condition
that evidence of it is not to be given, or under circumstances from which the Court can infer
that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.
Explanation.—Nothing in this section shall be taken to exempt any advocate from
giving evidence of any matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under
sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 132.
22.A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if
the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement,
threat, coercion or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person,
proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the
accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by
making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to
the proceedings against him:
Provided that if the confession is made after the impression caused by any such
inducement, threat, coercion or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been fully removed,
it is relevant:
Provided further that if such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not become
irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a
deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was
drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered,
whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he
was not bound to make such confession, and that evidence of it might be given against him.
23.(1) No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person
accused of any offence.
(2) No confession made by any person while he is in the custody of a police officer,
unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate shall be proved against him:

Provided that when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information
received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much
of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the
fact discovered, may be proved.
24.When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a
confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons
is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other
person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
ExplanationI.—"Offence", as used in this section, includes the abetment of, or
attempt to commit, the offence.
ExplanationII.—A trial of more persons than one held in the absence of the accused
who has absconded or who fails to comply with a proclamation issued under section 84 of
the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 shall be deemed to be a joint trial for the
purpose of this section.
Illustrations.
(a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A said—"B and I
murdered C". The Court may consider the effect of this confession as against B.
(b) A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C was murdered
by A and B, and that B said—"A and I murdered C". This statement may not be taken into
consideration by the Court against A, as B is not being jointly tried.
25.Admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted but they may operate
as estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained.
Statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses
26.Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or
who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance
cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances
of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following
cases, namely:—
(a) when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as
to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in
which the cause of that person's death comes into question. Such statements are
relevant whether the person who made them was or was not, at the time when they
were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the
proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question;
(b) when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of
business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him
in books kept in the ordinary course of business, or in the discharge of professional
duty; or of an acknowledgement written or signed by him of the receipt of money,
goods, securities or property of any kind; or of a document used in commerce written
or signed by him; or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or
signed by him;
(c) when the statement is against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the
person making it, or when, if true, it would expose him or would have exposed him to
a criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages;
(d) when the statement gives the opinion of any such person, as to the existence
of any public right or custom or matter of public or general interest, of the existence of
which, if it existed, he would have been likely to be aware, and when such statement
was made before any controversy as to such right, custom or matter had arisen;

(e) when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood,
marriage or adoption between persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption the person making the statement had special means of knowledge, and
when the statement was made before the question in dispute was raised;
(f) when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood,
marriage or adoption between persons deceased, and is made in any will or deed
relating to the affairs of the family to which any such deceased person belonged, or in
any family pedigree, or upon any tombstone, family portrait or other thing on which
such statements are usually made, and when such statement was made before the
question in dispute was raised;
(g) when the statement is contained in any deed, will or other document which
relates to any such transaction as is specified in clause (a) of section 11;
(h) when the statement was made by a number of persons, and expressed
feelings or impressions on their part relevant to the matter in question.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A was murdered by B; or A dies of injuries received in a
transaction in the course of which she was raped. The question is whether she was raped
by B; or the question is, whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit
would lie against B by A's widow. Statements made by A as to the cause of his or her death,
referring respectively to the murder, the rape and the actionable wrong under consideration,
are relevant facts.
(b) The question is as to the date of A's birth. An entry in the diary of a deceased
surgeon regularly kept in the course of business, stating that, on a given day he attended
A's mother and delivered her of a son, is a relevant fact.
(c) The question is, whether A was in Nagpur on a given day. A statement in the diary
of a deceased solicitor, regularly kept in the course of business, that on a given day the
solicitor attended A at a place mentioned, in Nagpur, for the purpose of conferring with him
upon specified business, is a relevant fact.
(d) The question is, whether a ship sailed from Mumbai harbour on a given day. A
letter written by a deceased member of a merchant's firm by which she was chartered to their
correspondents in Chennai, to whom the cargo was consigned, stating that the ship sailed
on a given day from Mumbai port, is a relevant fact.
(e) The question is, whether rent was paid to A for certain land. A letter from A's
deceased agent to A, saying that he had received the rent on A's account and held it at A's
orders is a relevant fact.
(f) The question is, whether A and B were legally married. The statement of a deceased
clergyman that he married them under such circumstances that the celebration would be a
crime is relevant.
(g) The question is, whether A, a person who cannot be found, wrote a letter on a
certain day. The fact that a letter written by him is dated on that day is relevant.
(h) The question is, what was the cause of the wreck of a ship. A protest made by the
captain, whose attendance cannot be procured, is a relevant fact.
(i) The question is, whether a given road is a public way. A statement by A, a deceased
headman of the village, that the road was public, is a relevant fact.
(j) The question is, what was the price of grain on a certain day in a particular market.
A statement of the price, made by a deceased business person in the ordinary course of his
business, is a relevant fact.
Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y 13_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(k) The question is, whether A, who is dead, was the father of B. A statement byA that
B was his son, is a relevant fact.
(l) The question is, what was the date of the birth of A. A letter from A's deceased
father to a friend, announcing the birth of A on a given day, is a relevant fact.
(m) The question is, whether, and when, A and B were married. An entry in a
memorandum book by C, the deceased father of B, of his daughter's marriage with A on a
given date, is a relevant fact.
(n) A sues B for a libel expressed in a painted caricature exposed in a shop window.
The question is as to the similarity of the caricature and its libellous character. The remarks
of a crowd of spectators on these points may be proved.
27.Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person
authorised by law to take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial
proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which
it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence,
or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without
an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court
considers unreasonable:
Provided that the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives in
interest; that the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to
cross-examine and the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the
second proceeding.
Explanation.—A criminal trial or inquiry shall be deemed to be a proceeding between
the prosecutor and the accused within the meaning of this section.
Statements made under special circumstances
28.Entries in the books of account, including those maintained in an electronic form,
regularly kept in the course of business are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into
which the Court has to inquire, but such statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence
to charge any person with liability.
Illustration.
A sues B for one thousand rupees, and shows entries in his account books showing
B to be indebted to him to this amount. The entries are relevant, but are not sufficient,
without other evidence, to prove the debt.
29.An entry in any public or other official book, register or record or an electronic
record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, and made by a public servant in the discharge
of his official duty, or by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by
the law of the country in which such book, register or record or an electronic record, is kept,
is itself a relevant fact.
30.Statements of facts in issue or relevant facts, made in published maps or charts
generally offered for public sale, or in maps or plans made under the authority of the Central
Government or any State Government, as to matters usually represented or stated in such
maps, charts or plans, are themselves relevant facts.
31.When the Court has to form an opinion as to the existence of any fact of a public
nature, any statement of it, made in a recital contained in any Central Act or State Act or in
a Central Government or State Government notification appearing in the respective Official
Gazette or in any printed paper or in electronic or digital form purporting to be such Gazette,
is a relevant fact.

32.When the Court has to form an opinion as to a law of any country, any statement
of such law contained in a book purporting to be printed or published including in electronic
or digital form under the authority of the Government of such country and to contain any
such law, and any report of a ruling of the Courts of such country contained in a book
including in electronic or digital form purporting to be a report of such rulings, is relevant.
How much of a statement is to be proved
33.When any statement of which evidence is given forms part of a longer statement,
or of a conversation or part of an isolated document, or is contained in a document which
forms part of a book, or is contained in part of electronic record or of a connected series of
letters or papers, evidence shall be given of so much and no more of the statement,
conversation, document, electronic record, book or series of letters or papers as the Court
considers necessary in that particular case to the full understanding of the nature and effect
of the statement, and of the circumstances under which it was made.
Judgments of Courts when relevant
34.The existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any Court
from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial, is a relevant fact when the question is
whether such Court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial.
35.(1) A final judgment, order or decree of a competent Court or Tribunal, in the
exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction, which confers upon
or takes away from any person any legal character, or which declares any person to be
entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any specific thing, not as against any
specified person but absolutely, is relevant when the existence of any such legal character,
or the title of any such person to any such thing, is relevant.
(2) Such judgment, order or decree is conclusive proof that—
(i) any legal character, which it confers accrued at the time when such judgment,
order or decree came into operation;
(ii) any legal character, to which it declares any such person to be entitled,
accrued to that person at the time when such judgment, order or decree declares it to
have accrued to that person;
(iii) any legal character which it takes away from any such person ceased at the
time from which such judgment, order or decree declared that it had ceased or should
cease; and
(iv) anything to which it declares any person to be so entitled was the property
of that person at the time from which such judgment, order or decree declares that it
had been or should be his property.
36.Judgments, orders or decrees other than those mentioned in section 35 are relevant
if they relate to matters of a public nature relevant to the enquiry; but such judgments,
orders or decrees are not conclusive proof of that which they state.
Illustration.
A sues B for trespass on his land. B alleges the existence of a public right of way over
the land, which A denies. The existence of a decree in favour of the defendant, in a suit by
A against C for a trespass on the same land, in which C alleged the existence of the same
right of way, is relevant, but it is not conclusive proof that the right of way exists.

37.Judgments or orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in sections 34, 35
and 36, are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in
issue, or is relevant under some other provision of this Adhiniyam.
Illustrations.
(a) A and B separately sue C for a libel which reflects upon each of them. C in each
case says that the matter alleged to be libellous is true, and the circumstances are such that
it is probably true in each case, or in neither. A obtains a decree against C for damages on the
ground that C failed to make out his justification. The fact is irrelevant as between B and C.
(b) A prosecutes B for stealing a cow from him. B is convicted. A afterwards sues C
for the cow, which B had sold to him before his conviction. As between A and C, the
judgment against B is irrelevant.
(c) A has obtained a decree for the possession of land against B. C, B's son, murders
A in consequence. The existence of the judgment is relevant, as showing motive for a crime.
(d) A is charged with theft and with having been previously convicted of theft. The
previous conviction is relevant as a fact in issue.
(e) Ais tried for the murder of B. The fact that B prosecutedA for libel and that Awas
convicted and sentenced is relevant under section 6 as showing the motive for the fact in
issue.
38.Any party to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment, order or
decree which is relevant under section 34, 35 or 36, and which has been proved by the
adverse party, was delivered by a Court not competent to deliver it, or was obtained by
fraud or collusion.
Opinions of third persons when relevant
39.(1) When the Court has to form an opinion upon a point of foreign law or of
science or art, or any other field, or as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions, the
opinions upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science or art, or
any other field, or in questions as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions are
relevant facts and such persons are called experts.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether the death of A was caused by poison. The opinions of
experts as to the symptoms produced by the poison by which A is supposed to have died,
are relevant.
(b) The question is, whether A, at the time of doing a certain act, was, by reason of
unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he was doing what
was either wrong or contrary to law. The opinions of experts upon the question whether the
symptoms exhibited by A commonly show unsoundness of mind, and whether such
unsoundness of mind usually renders persons incapable of knowing the nature of the acts
which they do, or of knowing that what they do is either wrong or contrary to law, are
relevant.
(c) The question is, whether a certain document was written by A.Another document
is produced which is proved or admitted to have been written by A. The opinions of experts

on the question whether the two documents were written by the same person or by different
persons, are relevant.
(2) When in a proceeding, the court has to form an opinion on any matter relating to
any information transmitted or stored in any computer resource or any other electronic or
digital form, the opinion of the Examiner of Electronic Evidence referred to in section 79A of
the Information Technology Act, 2000, is a relevant fact.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, an Examiner of Electronic Evidence
shall be an expert.
40.Facts, not otherwise relevant, are relevant if they support or are inconsistent
with the opinions of experts, when such opinions are relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A was poisoned by a certain poison. The fact that other
persons, who were poisoned by that poison, exhibited certain symptoms which experts
affirm or deny to be the symptoms of that poison, is relevant.
(b) The question is, whether an obstruction to a harbour is caused by a certain
sea-wall. The fact that other harbours similarly situated in other respects, but where there
were no such sea-walls, began to be obstructed at about the same time, is relevant.
41.(1) When the Court has to form an opinion as to the person by whom any document
was written or signed, the opinion of any person acquainted with the handwriting of the
person by whom it is supposed to be written or signed that it was or was not written or
signed by that person, is a relevant fact.
Explanation.—A person is said to be acquainted with the handwriting of another
person when he has seen that person write, or when he has received documents purporting
to be written by that person in answer to documents written by himself or under his authority
and addressed to that person, or when, in the ordinary course of business, documents
purporting to be written by that person have been habitually submitted to him.
Illustration.
The question is, whether a given letter is in the handwriting of A, a merchant in
Itanagar. B is a merchant in Bengaluru, who has written letters addressed to A and received
letters purporting to be written by him. C, is B's clerk whose duty it was to examine and file
B's correspondence. D is B's broker, to whom B habitually submitted the letters purporting
to be written by A for the purpose of advising him thereon. The opinions of B, C and D on
the question whether the letter is in the handwriting of A are relevant, though neither B, C
nor D ever saw A write.
(2) When the Court has to form an opinion as to the electronic signature of any
person, the opinion of the Certifying Authority which has issued the Electronic Signature
Certificate is a relevant fact.
42.When the Court has to form an opinion as to the existence of any general custom
or right, the opinions, as to the existence of such custom or right, of persons who would be
likely to know of its existence if it existed, are relevant.
Explanation.—The expression "general custom or right" includes customs or rights
common to any considerable class of persons.
Illustration.
The right of the villagers of a particular village to use the water of a particular well is
a general right within the meaning of this section.
43.When the Court has to form an opinion as to—
(i) the usages and tenets of any body of men or family;

(ii) the constitution and governance of any religious or charitable
foundation; or
(iii) the meaning of words or terms used in particular districts or by particular
classes of people,
the opinions of persons having special means of knowledge thereon, are relevant facts.
44.When the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to
another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such relationship, of any
person who, as a member of the family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the
subject, is a relevant fact:
Provided that such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage in proceedings
under the Divorce Act, 1869, or in prosecution under sections 82 and 84 of the Bharatiya
Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A and B were married. The fact that they were usually
received and treated by their friends as husband and wife, is relevant.
(b) The question is, whether A was the legitimate son of B. The fact that A was always
treated as such by members of the family, is relevant.
45.Whenever the opinion of any living person is relevant, the grounds on which
such opinion is based are also relevant.
Illustration.
An expert may give an account of experiments performed by him for the purpose of
forming his opinion.
Character when relevant
46.In civil cases the fact that the character of any person concerned is such as to
render probable or improbable any conduct imputed to him, is irrelevant, except in so far as
such character appears from facts otherwise relevant.
47.In criminal proceedings the fact that the person accused is of a good character, is
relevant.
48.In a prosecution for an offence under section 64, section 65, section 66,
section 67, section 68, section 69, section 70, section 71, section 74, section 75, section 76,
section 77 or section 78 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 or for attempt to commit any
such offence, where the question of consent is in issue, evidence of the character of the
victim or of such person's previous sexual experience with any person shall not be relevant
on the issue of such consent or the quality of consent.
49.In criminal proceedings, the fact that the accused has a bad character, is irrelevant,
unless evidence has been given that he has a good character, in which case it becomes
relevant.
Explanation1.—This section does not apply to cases in which the bad character of
any person is itself a fact in issue.
Explanation2.—A previous conviction is relevant as evidence of bad character.

50.In civil cases, the fact that the character of any person is such as to affect the
amount of damages which he ought to receive, is relevant.
Explanation.—In this section and sections 46, 47 and 49, the word "character"
includes both reputation and disposition; but, except as provided in section 49, evidence
may be given only of general reputation and general disposition, and not of particular acts
by which reputation or disposition has been shown.
PART III
ON PROOF
CHAPTER III
FACTS WHICH NEED NOT BE PROVED

particular ship was orally excepted from the policy, cannot be proved.
(b) A agrees absolutely in writing to pay B one thousand rupees on the
1st March, 2023. The fact that, at the same time, an oral agreement was made that the money
should not be paid till the 31st March, 2023, cannot be proved.
(c) An estate called "the Rampur tea estate" is sold by a deed which contains a map
of the property sold. The fact that land not included in the map had always been regarded
as part of the estate and was meant to pass by the deed cannot be proved.
(d) A enters into a written contract with B to work certain mines, the property of B,
upon certain terms. A was induced to do so by a misrepresentation of B's as to their value.
This fact may be proved.
(e) A institutes a suit against B for the specific performance of a contract, and also
prays that the contract may be reformed as to one of its provisions, as that provision was
inserted in it by mistake. Amay prove that such a mistake was made as would by law entitle
him to have the contract reformed.
(f) A orders goods of B by a letter in which nothing is said as to the time of payment,
and accepts the goods on delivery. B sues A for the price. A may show that the goods were
supplied on credit for a term still unexpired.
(g) A sells B a horse and verbally warrants him sound. A gives B a paper in these
words—"Bought of Aa horse for thirty thousand rupees". B may prove the verbal warranty.
(h) A hires lodgings of B, and gives B a card on which is written—"Rooms, ten
thousand rupees a month". A may prove a verbal agreement that these terms were to
include partial board. A hires lodging of B for a year, and a regularly stamped agreement,
drawn up by an advocate, is made between them. It is silent on the subject of board. A may
not prove that board was included in the term verbally.
(i) A applies to B for a debt due to A by sending a receipt for the money. B keeps the
receipt and does not send the money. In a suit for the amount, A may prove this.

contingency. The writing is left with B who sues A upon it. A may show the circumstances
under which it was delivered.

evidence may not be given of facts which would show its meaning or supply its defects.
Illustrations.
(a) A agrees, in writing, to sell a horse to B for "one lakh rupees or one lakh fifty
thousand rupees". Evidence cannot be given to show which price was to be given.

97.When language used in a document is plain in itself, and when it applies accurately
to existing facts, evidence may not be given to show that it was not meant to apply to such
facts.
Illustration.
A sells to B, by deed, "my estate at Rampur containing one hundredbighas". A has an
estate at Rampur containing one hundredbighas. Evidence may not be given of the fact
that the estate meant to be sold was one situated at a different place and of a different size.
98.When language used in a document is plain in itself, but is unmeaning in reference
to existing facts, evidence may be given to show that it was used in a peculiar sense.
Illustration.
A sells to B, by deed, "my house in Kolkata". A had no house in Kolkata, but it
appears that he had a house at Howrah, of which B had been in possession since the
execution of the deed. These facts may be proved to show that the deed related to the
house at Howrah.
99.When the facts are such that the language used might have been meant to apply
to any one, and could not have been meant to apply to more than one, of several persons or
things, evidence may be given of facts which show which of those persons or things it was
intended to apply to.
Illustrations.
(a) A agrees to sell to B, for one thousand rupees, "my white horse". A has two white
horses. Evidence may be given of facts which show which of them was meant.
(b) A agrees to accompany B to Ramgarh. Evidence may be given of facts showing
whether Ramgarh in Rajasthan or Ramgarh in Uttarakhand was meant.
100.When the language used applies partly to one set of existing facts, and partly to
another set of existing facts, but the whole of it does not apply correctly to either, evidence
may be given to show to which of the two it was meant to apply.
Illustration.
A agrees to sell to B "my land at X in the occupation of Y". A has land at X, but not
in the occupation of Y , and he has land in the occupation of Y but it is not at X. Evidence
may be given of facts showing which he meant to sell.

intelligible characters, of foreign, obsolete, technical, local and regional expressions, of
abbreviations and of words used in a peculiar sense.

delivery. At the same time, they make an oral agreement that three months’ credit shall be
given to A. This could not be shown as between A and B, but it might be shown by C, if it
affected his interests.

PARTIV
PRODUCTION AND EFFECT OF EVIDENCE
CHAPTERVII
OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF
104.Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability
dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist, and
when a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof
lies on that person.
Illustrations.
(a) A desires a Court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A
says B has committed. A must prove that B has committed the crime.
(b) A desires a Court to give judgment that he is entitled to certain land in the
possession of B, by reason of facts which he asserts, and which B denies, to be true. A must
prove the existence of those facts.
105. The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if
no evidence at all were given on either side.
Illustrations.
(a) A sues B for land of which B is in possession, and which, as A asserts, was left to
A by the will of C, B's father. If no evidence were given on either side, B would be entitled to
retain his possession. Therefore, the burden of proof is on A.
(b) A sues B for money due on a bond. The execution of the bond is admitted, but B
says that it was obtained by fraud, which A denies. If no evidence were given on either side,
A would succeed, as the bond is not disputed and the fraud is not proved. Therefore, the
burden of proof is on B.
106.The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the
Court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact
shall lie on any particular person.
Illustration.
A prosecutes B for theft, and wishes the Court to believe that B admitted the theft to
C. A must prove the admission. B wishes the Court to believe that, at the time in question,
he was elsewhere. He must prove it.
107.The burden of proving any fact necessary to be proved in order to enable any
person to give evidence of any other fact is on the person who wishes to give such
evidence.
Illustrations.
(a) A wishes to prove a dying declaration by B. A must prove B's death.
(b) A wishes to prove, by secondary evidence, the contents of a lost document. A
must prove that the document has been lost.
108. When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of
circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Bharatiya
Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part
of the said Sanhita, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall
presume the absence of such circumstances.

deprived of the power of self-control. The burden of proof is on A.
(c) Section 117 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 provides that whoever, except in
the case provided for by sub-section (2) of section 122, voluntarily causes grievous hurt,
shall be subject to certain punishments. A is charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt
under section 117. The burden of proving the circumstances bringing the case under
sub-section (2) of section 122 lies on A.
109.When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of
proving that fact is upon him.
Illustrations.
(a) When a person does an act with some intention other than that which the character
and circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon him.
(b) A is charged with travelling on a railway without a ticket. The burden of proving
that he had a ticket is on him.
110. When the question is whether a man is alive or dead, and it is shown that he was
alive within thirty years, the burden of proving that he is dead is on the person who affirms
it.
111.When the question is whether a man is alive or dead, and it is proved that he has
not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had
been alive, the burden of proving that he is alive is shifted to the person who affirms it.
112.When the question is whether persons are partners, landlord and tenant, or
principal and agent, and it has been shown that they have been acting as such, the burden
of proving that they do not stand, or have ceased to stand, to each other in those
relationships respectively, is on the person who affirms it.
113.When the question is whether any person is owner of anything of which he is
shown to be in possession, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is on the person
who affirms that he is not the owner.
114.Where there is a question as to the good faith of a transaction between parties,
one of whom stands to the other in a position of active confidence, the burden of proving
the good faith of the transaction is on the party who is in a position of active confidence.
Illustrations.

116.The fact that any person was born during the continuance of a valid marriage
between his mother and any man, or within two hundred and eighty days after its dissolution,
the mother remaining unmarried, shall be conclusive proof that he is the legitimate child of
that man, unless it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to each other
at any time when he could have been begotten.
117.When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been
abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had
committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her
husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the Court may
presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had
been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, "cruelty" shall have the same meaning
as in section 86 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.
118.When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a
woman and it is shown that soon before her death, such woman had been subjected by
such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the
Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, "dowry death" shall have the same
meaning as in section 80 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.

whether such maxims do or do not apply to the particular case before it:—
(i) as toIllustration (a)—a shop-keeper has in his bill a marked rupee soon after
it was stolen, and cannot account for its possession specifically, but is continually
receiving rupees in the course of his business;
(ii) as to Illustration (b)—A, a person of the highest character, is tried for
causing a man's death by an act of negligence in arranging certain machinery. B, a
person of equally good character, who also took part in the arrangement, describes
precisely what was done, and admits and explains the common carelessness of A and
himself;
(iii) as toIllustration (b)—a crime is committed by several persons.A, B and C,
three of the criminals, are captured on the spot and kept apart from each other. Each
gives an account of the crime implicating D, and the accounts corroborate each other
in such a manner as to render previous concert highly improbable;
(iv) as to Illustration (c)—A, the drawer of a bill of exchange, was a man of
business. B, the acceptor, was a young and ignorant person, completely under A's
influence;
(v) as toIllustration (d)—it is proved that a river ran in a certain course five

change its course;
(vi) as to Illustration (e)—a judicial act, the regularity of which is in question,
was performed under exceptional circumstances;
(vii) as toIllustration (f)—the question is, whether a letter was received. It is
shown to have been posted, but the usual course of the post was interrupted by
disturbances;
(viii) as to Illustration (g)—a man refuses to produce a document which would
bear on a contract of small importance on which he is sued, but which might also
injure the feelings and reputation of his family;
(ix) as toIllustration (h)—a man refuses to answer a question which he is not
compelled by law to answer, but the answer to it might cause loss to him in matters
unconnected with the matter in relation to which it is asked;
(x) as to Illustration (i)—a bond is in possession of the obligor, but the
circumstances of the case are such that he may have stolen it.
120.In a prosecution for rape under sub-section (2) of section 64 of the Bharatiya
Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, where sexual intercourse by the accused is proved and the question

Illustration.
A intentionally and falsely leads B to believe that certain land belongs to A, and

Explanation.—The obligation stated in this section continues after the professional
service has ceased.
Illustrations.

the use of a forged deed on which I request you to sue". This communication, being made
in furtherance of a criminal purpose, is not protected from disclosure.
(c)A, being charged with embezzlement, retains B, an advocate, to defend him. In the
course of the proceedings, B observes that an entry has been made in A's account book,
charging A with the sum said to have been embezzled, which entry was not in the book at
the commencement of his professional service. This being a fact observed by B in the
course of his service, showing that a fraud has been committed since the commencement of
the proceedings, it is not protected from disclosure.
(3) The provisions of this section shall apply to interpreters, and the clerks or
employees of advocates.
133.If any party to a suit gives evidence therein at his own instance or otherwise, he
shall not be deemed to have consented thereby to such disclosure as is mentioned in
section 132; and, if any party to a suit or proceeding calls any such advocate, as a witness,
he shall be deemed to have consented to such disclosure only if he questions such advocate,
on matters which, but for such question, he would not be at liberty to disclose.
134. No one shall be compelled to disclose to the Court any confidential communication
which has taken place between him and his legal adviser, unless he offers himself as a
witness, in which case he may be compelled to disclose any such communications as may
appear to the Court necessary to be known in order to explain any evidence which he has
given, but no others.
135.No witness who is not a party to a suit shall be compelled to produce his
title-deeds to any property, or any document in virtue of which he holds any property as
pledgee or mortgagee or any document the production of which might tend to criminate
him, unless he has agreed in writing to produce them with the person seeking the production
of such deeds or some person through whom he claims.
136. No one shall be compelled to produce documents in his possession or electronic
records under his control, which any other person would be entitled to refuse to produce if
they were in his possession or control, unless such last-mentioned person consents to
their production.
137.A witness shall not be excused from answering any question as to any matter
relevant to the matter in issue in any suit or in any civil or criminal proceeding, upon the
ground that the answer to such question will criminate, or may tend directly or indirectly to
criminate, such witness, or that it will expose, or tend directly or indirectly to expose, such
witness to a penalty or forfeiture of any kind:
Provided that no such answer, which a witness shall be compelled to give, shall
subject him to any arrest or prosecution, or be proved against him in any criminal proceeding,
except a prosecution forgiving false evidence by such answer.

138.An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person;
and a conviction is not illegal if it proceeds upon the corroborated testimony of an
accomplice.
139.No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of
any fact.
CHAPTER X
OF EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES
140.The order in which witnesses are produced and examined shall be regulated by
the law and practice for the time being relating to civil and criminal procedure respectively,
and, in the absence of any such law, by the discretion of the Court.
141.(1) When either party proposes to give evidence of any fact, the Judge may ask
the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact, if proved, would
be relevant; and the Judge shall admit the evidence if he thinks that the fact, if proved,
would be relevant, and not otherwise.
(2) If the fact proposed to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon
proof of some other fact, such last mentioned fact must be proved before evidence is given
of the fact first mentioned, unless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact, and the
Court is satisfied with such undertaking.
(3) If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being first
proved, the Judge may, in his discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given
before the second fact is proved, or require evidence to be given of the second fact before
evidence is given of the first fact.
Illustrations.
(a) It is proposed to prove a statement about a relevant fact by a person alleged to be
dead, which statement is relevant under section 26. The fact that the person is dead must be
proved by the person proposing to prove the statement, before evidence is given of the
statement.
(b) It is proposed to prove, by a copy, the contents of a document said to be lost. The
fact that the original is lost must be proved by the person proposing to produce the copy,
before the copy is produced.
(c) A is accused of receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen. It is
proposed to prove that he denied the possession of the property. The relevancy of the
denial depends on the identity of the property. The Court may, in its discretion, either
require the property to be identified before the denial of the possession is proved, or permit
the denial of the possession to be proved before the property is identified.
(d) It is proposed to prove a fact A which is said to have been the cause or effect of a
fact in issue. There are several intermediate facts B, C and D which must be shown to exist
before the fact A can be regarded as the cause or effect of the fact in issue. The Court may
either permit A to be proved before B, C or D is proved, or may require proof of B, C and D
before permitting proof of A.
142.(1) The examination of a witness by the party who calls him shall be called his
examination-in-chief.
(2) The examination of a witness by the adverse party shall be called his
cross-examination.
(3) The examination of a witness, subsequent to the cross-examination, by the party
who called him, shall be called his re-examination.

Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y 39_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

143.(1) Witnesses shall be first examined-in-chief, then (if the adverse party so
desires) cross-examined, then (if the party calling him so desires) re-examined.
(2) The examination-in-chief and cross-examination must relate to relevant facts, but
the cross-examination need not be confined to the facts to which the witness testified on
his examination-in-chief.
(3) The re-examination shall be directed to the explanation of matters referred to in
cross-examination; and, if new matter is, by permission of the Court, introduced in
re-examination, the adverse party may further cross-examine upon that matter.
144.A person summoned to produce a document does not become a witness by the
mere fact that he produces it, and cannot be cross-examined unless and until he is called as
a witness.
145.Witnesses to character may be cross-examined and re-examined.
146.(1) Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or
expects to receive, is called a leading question.
(2) Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in an
examination-in-chief, or in a re-examination, except with the permission of the Court.
(3) The Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or
undisputed, or which have, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved.
(4) Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination.
147.Any witness may be asked, while under examination, whether any contract,
grant or other disposition of property, as to which he is giving evidence, was not contained
in a document, and if he says that it was, or if he is about to make any statement as to the
contents of any document, which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to be produced, the
adverse party may object to such evidence being given until such document is produced,
or until facts have been proved which entitle the party who called the witness to give
secondary evidence of it.
Explanation.—A witness may give oral evidence of statements made by other persons
about the contents of documents if such statements are in themselves relevant facts.
Illustration.
The question is, whether A assaulted B. C deposes that he heard A say to D—"B
wrote a letter accusing me of theft, and I will be revenged on him". This statement is
relevant, as showing A's motive for the assault, and evidence may be given of it, though no
other evidence is given about the letter.
148.A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in
writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question, without such writing
being shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended to contradict him by the writing,
his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are
to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.
149.When a witness is cross-examined, he may, in addition to the questions
hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend—
(a) to test his veracity; or
(b) to discover who he is and what is his position in life; or
(c) to shake his credit, by injuring his character, although the answer to such
questions might tend directly or indirectly to criminate him, or might expose or tend
directly or indirectly to expose him to a penalty or forfeiture:

Provided that in a prosecution for an offence under section 64, section 65, section 66,
section 67, section 68, section 69, section 70 or section 71 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita,
2023 or for attempt to commit any such offence, where the question of consent is an issue,
it shall not be permissible to adduce evidence or to put questions in the cross-examination
of the victim as to the general immoral character, or previous sexual experience, of such
victim with any person for proving such consent or the quality of consent.
150.If any such question relates to a matter relevant to the suit or proceeding, the
provisions of section 137 shall apply thereto.
151.(1) If any such question relates to a matter not relevant to the suit or proceeding,
except in so far as it affects the credit of the witness by injuring his character, the Court shall
decide whether or not the witness shall be compelled to answer it, and may, if it thinks fit,
warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer it.
(2) In exercising its discretion, the Court shall have regard to the following
considerations, namely:—
(a) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the
imputation conveyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the Court as to
the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies;
(b) such questions are improper if the imputation which they convey relates to
matters so remote in time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would
not affect, or would affect in a slight degree, the opinion of the Court as to the
credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies;
(c) such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the
importance of the imputation made against the witness's character and the importance
of his evidence;
(d) the Court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the witness's refusal to answer, the
inference that the answer if given would be unfavourable.
152.No such question as is referred to in section 151 ought to be asked, unless the
person asking it has reasonable grounds for thinking that the imputation which it conveys
is well-founded.
Illustrations.
(a) An advocate is instructed by another advocate that an important witness is a
dacoit. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dacoit.
(b)An advocate is informed by a person in Court that an important witness is a dacoit.
The informant, on being questioned by the advocate, gives satisfactory reasons for his
statement. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dacoit.
(c) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, is asked at random whether he is
a dacoit. There are here no reasonable grounds for the question.
(d) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, being questioned as to his mode
of life and means of living, gives unsatisfactory answers. This may be a reasonable ground
for asking him if he is a dacoit.
153.If the Court is of opinion that any such question was asked without reasonable
grounds, it may, if it was asked by any advocate, report the circumstances of the case to the
High Court or other authority to which such advocate is subject in the exercise of his
profession.

154.The Court may forbid any questions or inquiries which it regards as indecent or
scandalous, although such questions or inquiries may have some bearing on the questions
before the Court, unless they relate to facts in issue, or to matters necessary to be known in
order to determine whether or not the facts in issue existed.
155.The Court shall forbid any question which appears to it to be intended to insult
or annoy, or which, though proper in itself, appears to the Court needlessly offensive in
form.
156. When a witness has been asked and has answered any question which is relevant
to the inquiry only in so far as it tends to shake his credit by injuring his character, no
evidence shall be given to contradict him; but, if he answers falsely, he may afterwards be
charged with giving false evidence.
Exception1.—If a witness is asked whether he has been previously convicted of any
crime and denies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction.
Exception2.—If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality,
and answers it by denying the facts suggested, he may be contradicted.
Illustrations.
(a) A claim against an underwriter is resisted on the ground of fraud. The claimant is
asked whether, in a former transaction, he had not made a fraudulent claim. He denies it.
Evidence is offered to show that he did make such a claim. The evidence is inadmissible.
(b) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed from a situation for dishonesty.
He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that he was dismissed for dishonesty. The evidence
is not admissible.
(c) A affirms that on a certain day he saw B at Goa. A is asked whether he himself was
not on that day at Varanasi. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that A was on that day
at Varanasi. The evidence is admissible, not as contradicting A on a fact which affects his
credit, but as contradicting the alleged fact that B was seen on the day in question in Goa.
In each of these cases, the witness might, if his denial was false, be charged with giving
false evidence.
(d)A is asked whether his family has not had a blood feud with the family of B against
whom he gives evidence. He denies it. He may be contradicted on the ground that the
question tends to impeach his impartiality.
157. (1) The Court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put
any question to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party.
(2) Nothing in this section shall disentitle the person so permitted under
sub-section (1), to rely on any part of the evidence of such witness.
158.The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse
party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls him—
(a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of
the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit;
(b) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a
bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence
which is liable to be contradicted.
Explanation.—A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may
not, upon his examination-in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked his
reasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot be contradicted,
though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence.

Illustrations.
(a) A sues B for the price of goods sold and delivered to B. C says that he delivered
the goods to B. Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, he said that he
had not delivered goods to B. The evidence is admissible.
(b) A is accused of the murder of B. C says that B, when dying, declared that A had
given B the wound of which he died. Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous
occasion, C said that B, when dying, did not declare that A had given B the wound of which
he died. The evidence is admissible.
159.When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence of any
relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which he observed at or
near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred, if the Court is of opinion that
such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as to the
relevant fact which he testifies.
Illustration.
A, an accomplice, gives an account of a robbery in which he took part. He describes
various incidents unconnected with the robbery which occurred on his way to and from the
place where it was committed. Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order to
corroborate his evidence as to the robbery itself.
160.In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by
such witness relating to the same fact, at or about the time when the fact took place, or
before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.
161.Whenever any statement, relevant under section 26 or 27, is proved, all matters
may be proved either in order to contradict or to corroborate it, or in order to impeach or
confirm the credit of the person by whom it was made, which might have been proved if that
person had been called as a witness and had denied upon cross-examination the truth of the
matter suggested.
162. (1) A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by referring to
any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned,
or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time
fresh in his memory:
Provided that the witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other
person, and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if when he read it, he knew it to be
correct.
(2) Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he
may, with the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of such document:
Provided that the Court be satisfied that there is sufficient reason for the
non-production of the original:
Provided further that an expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional
treatises.
163.A witness may also testify to facts mentioned in any such document as is
mentioned in section 162, although he has no specific recollection of the facts themselves,
if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document.

Illustration.
A book-keeper may testify to facts recorded by him in books regularly kept in the
course of business, if he knows that the books were correctly kept, although he has forgotten
the particular transactions entered.
164.Any writing referred to under the provisions of the two last preceding sections
shall be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires it; such party may, if he
pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon.
165. (1) A witness summoned to produce a document shall, if it is in his possession or
power, bring it to Court, notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its production
or to its admissibility:
Provided that the validity of any such objection shall be decided on by the Court.
(2) The Court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document, unless it refers to matters of
State, or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility.
(3) If for such a purpose it is necessary to cause any document to be translated, the
Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret, unless the
document is to be given in evidence and, if the interpreter disobeys such direction, he shall
be held to have committed an offence under section 198 of the Bharatiya Nyaya
Sanhita, 2023:
Provided that no Court shall require any communication between the Ministers and
the President of India to be produced before it.
166.When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to
produce, and such document is produced and inspected by the party calling for its
production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it requires him to do so.
167. When a party refuses to produce a document which he has had notice to produce,
he cannot afterwards use the document as evidence without the consent of the other party
or the order of the Court.
Illustration.
A sues B on an agreement and gives B notice to produce it. At the trial, A calls for the
document and B refuses to produce it. A gives secondary evidence of its contents. B seeks
to produce the document itself to contradict the secondary evidence given by A, or in order
to show that the agreement is not stamped. He cannot do so.
168.The Judge may, in order to discover or obtain proof of relevant facts, ask any
question he considers necessary, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties
about any fact; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the
parties nor their representatives shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question
or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer
given in reply to any such question:
Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Adhiniyam to
be relevant, and duly proved:
Provided further that this section shall not authorise any Judge to compel any witness
to answer any question, or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled
to refuse to answer or produce under sections 127 to 136, both inclusive, if the question
were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask
any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under section 151 or
152; nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of any document, except in the cases
hereinbefore excepted.

CHAPTER XI
OF IMPROPER ADMISSION AND REJECTION OF EVIDENCE
169.The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for
a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case, if it shall appear to the Court before which
such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there
was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been
received, it ought not to have varied the decision.
CHAPTER XII
REPEAL AND SAVINGS
170. (1) The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is hereby repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, if, immediately before the date on which this
Adhiniyam comes into force, there is any application, trial, inquiry, investigation, proceeding
or appeal pending, then, such application, trial, inquiry, investigation, proceeding or appeal
shall be dealt with under the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, as in force

only of culpable homicide.

been sentenced for the offence.
(5) If the offence is punishable with fine or community service, the imprisonment

property which would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts.

him could award for any one of such offences.

imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the
whole beating.
(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y , here, as the
blow given to Y is no part of the act whereby Avoluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one
punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y .
10.In all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several
offences specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is
guilty, the offender shall be punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is

months, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole
imprisonment awarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not
less duration than such periods.

himself to be justified by law, in doing it.
Illustration.
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his
judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending
murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has
committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence.
18.Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, and without any
criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful
means and with proper care and caution.
Illustration.
A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here,
if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an
offence.
19.Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that
it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in
good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.
Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented
or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the
act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.
Illustrations.
(a) A, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his
part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably
run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course
of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C
with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if Aalters his course
without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding
the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run
down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found
as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in
incurring the risk of running down the boat C.
(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from
spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property.
Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to
excuse A’s act, A is not guilty of the offence.

20.Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age.
21.Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under
twelve years of age, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of
the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion.
22.Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by
reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is
doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.
23. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by
reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is
either wrong, or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.
24.In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge
or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with
as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless
the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against
his will.
25.Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not
known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any
harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen
years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by
reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such
person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration.
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the
consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused
without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.
26.Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm
which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely
to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a
consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration.
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who
suffers under the painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z’s death, and intending, in
good faith, Z’s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z’s consent. A has committed no
offence.
27.Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years
of age, or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent, either express or implied, of the
guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any
harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be
likely to cause to that person:
Provided that this exception shall not extend to––
(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause

curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous
hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of
any grievous disease or infirmity;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not
extend.
Illustration.
A, in good faith, for his child’s benefit without his child’s consent, has his child cut for
the stone by a surgeon knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child’s death,
but not intending to cause the child’s death. A is within the exception, in as much as his
object was the cure of the child.
28.A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Sanhita,––
(a) if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception
of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the
consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or
(b) if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or
intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he
gives his consent; or
(c) unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a
person who is under twelve years of age.
29.The exceptions in sections 25, 26 and 27 do not extend to acts which are offences
independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to
be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given.
Illustration.
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the
woman) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to
the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the consent of the
woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.
30.Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for
whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person’s consent, if the circumstances
are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable
of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it
is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit:
Provided that this exception shall not extend to––
(a) the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause
death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the
curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any
purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not
extend.

be trepanned. A, not intending Z’s death, but in good faith, for Z’s benefit, performs the
trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no offence.
(2) Z is carried off by a tiger. Afires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may
kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending Z’s benefit.A’s bullet gives Z a
mortal wound. A has committed no offence.
(3)A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an
operation be immediately performed. There is no time to apply to the child’s guardian. A
performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good faith, the
child’s benefit. A has committed no offence.
(4) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A
drops the child from the house top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but
not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child’s benefit. Here, even if
the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence.
Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of
sections 26, 27 and this section.
31.No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the
person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.
Illustration.
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live.
The patient dies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew
it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient’s death.
32.Except murder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an
offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of
doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise
be the consequence:
Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable
apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by
which he became subject to such constraint.
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being
beaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this
exception, on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that
is an offence by law.
Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant
death, to do a thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his
tools and to force the door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the
benefit of this exception.
33.Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or
that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.
Of  right  of  private defence
34. Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
35.Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 37, to
defend—
(a) his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting
the human body;
(b) the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other

person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery,
mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief
or criminal trespass.
36.When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by
reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the
intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of
that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he
would have if the act were that offence.
Illustrations.
(a) Z, a person of unsound mind, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. ButA has
the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith,
taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception,
commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would
have if Z were not acting under that misconception.
37.(1) There is no right of private defence,––
(a) against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death
or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good
faith under colour of his office, though that act, may not be strictly justifiable by law;
(b) against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death
or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public
servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not
be strictly justifiable by law;
(c) in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public
authorities.
(2) The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than
it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.
Explanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act
done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason
to believe, that the person doing the act is such public servant.
Explanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act
done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has
reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such
person states the authority under which he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he
produces such authority, if demanded.
38.The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions specified in
section 37, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the
offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter
enumerated, namely:—
(a) such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will
otherwise be the consequence of such assault;
(b) such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous
hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;
(c) an assault with the intention of committing rape;

(f) an assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under
circumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to
have recourse to the public authorities for his release;
(g) an act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer
acid which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise
be the consequence of such act.
39.If the offence be not of any of the descriptions specified in section 38, the right of
private defence of the body does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the
assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions specified in section 37, to the voluntary
causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.
40.The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable
apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence
though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such
apprehension of danger to the body continues.
41.The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions specified in
section 37, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the
offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise
of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—
(a) robbery;
(b) house-breaking after sunset and before sunrise;
(c) mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any building, tent
or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or as a place for
the custody of property;
(d) theft, mischief, or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may
reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence,
if such right of private defence is not exercised.
42. If the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which occasions
the exercise of the right of private defence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any
of the descriptions specified in section 41, that right does not extend to the voluntary
causing of death, but does extend, subject to the restrictions specified in section 37, to the
voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than death.
43.The right of private defence of property,––
(a) commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the property
commences;
(b) against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat with the
property or either the assistance of the public authorities is obtained, or the property
has been recovered;
(c) against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or attempts to
cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant
death or of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues;
(d) against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the offender
continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief;
(e) against house-breaking after sunset and before sunrise continues as long as
the house-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues.

extends to the running of that risk.
Illustration.
A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his
right of private defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming
young children who are mingled with the mob. Acommits no offence if by so firing he harms
any of the children.
CHAPTERIV
OF ABETMENT , CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY AND A TTEMPT
of abetment
45.A person abets the doing of a thing, who—
(a) instigates any person to do that thing; or
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the
doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment
of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts
to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
Illustration.
A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court to apprehend Z. B, knowing
that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents toA that C is Z, and thereby intentionally
causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act,
does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the
commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
46.A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the
commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of
committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.
Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an
offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.
Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act
abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be
caused.
Illustrations.
(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit
murder.
(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers
from the wound. Ais guilty of instigating B to commit murder.
Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law
of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as
that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.
Abetment of a
thing.
Abettor.
Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y 17_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Illustrations.
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an
act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an
offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is
guilty of abetting an offence.
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age,
to do an act which causes Z’s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the
absence of A and thereby causes Z’s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of
committing an offence, Ais liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable
by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to
the punishment of death.
(c) Ainstigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness
of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong
or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A’s instigation. B has committed
no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is
liable to the punishment provided for that offence.
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging
to Z out of Z’s possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the
property out of Z’s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A’s property. B, acting under
this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is
guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such
an abetment is also an offence.
Illustration.
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and
C commits that offence in consequence of B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his
offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is
also liable to the same punishment.
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by
conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is
sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.
Illustration.
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed thatA shall administer the poison.
B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but
without mentioning A’s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to
B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. Aadministers the poison; Z dies
in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged
in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the
offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.
47.A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Sanhita who, in India, abets
the commission of any act without and beyond India which would constitute an offence if
committed in India.
Illustration.
A, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in country X, to commit a murder in that country,
A is guilty of abetting murder.

Illustration.
A, in country X, instigates B, to commit a murder in India,Ais guilty of abetting murder.
49.Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of
the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Sanhita for the punishment of such
abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment,
when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or
with the aid which constitutes the abetment.
Illustrations.
(a) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits
that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.
(b) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the
poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the
conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. Here
B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the
punishment for murder.
50.Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the
act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the
punishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had been
done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other.
51.When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act
done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had directly abetted it:
Provided that the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was
committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the
conspiracy which constituted the abetment.
Illustrations.
(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that
purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the
food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence
of A’s instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of
the abetment,A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the
child to put the poison into the food of Y.
(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house, B sets fire to the house and at the same time
commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not
guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence
of the burning.
(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of
robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and

A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence,
resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the
officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress,

offences; and, if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the
distress, A will also be liable to punishment for each of the offences.

caused, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the
intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause
that effect.

of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall
also be liable to fine.

CHAPTERVI
OF OFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY
Of offences affecting life
100.Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death,
or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the
knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable
homicide.
Illustrations.
(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with
the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm,
treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.
(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or
knowing it to be likely to cause Z’s death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z.
Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.
(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush;
A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not
guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act
that he knew was likely to cause death.
Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring
under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other,
shall be deemed to have caused his death.
Selling child for
purposes of
prostitution,
etc.
Buying child
for purposes of
prostitution,
etc.
Culpable
homicide.
Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y 31_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such
bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper
remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.
Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother’s womb is not
homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any
part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been
completely born.
101.Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,––
(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
death; or
(b) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person
to whom the harm is caused; or
(c) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient
in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or
(d) if the person committing the act by which the death is caused, knows that it
is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily
injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring
the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
Illustrations.
(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits
murder.
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause
his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of
the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the
ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A,
not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the
ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may
intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or
such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.
(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of
a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder,
although he may not have intended to cause Z’s death.
(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one
of them.Ais guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any
particular individual.
Exception 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the
power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who
gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident:
Provided that the provocation is not,––
(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or
doing harm to any person;
(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the
lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;
(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent
the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.
Murder.
32 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y [Part II—_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Illustrations.
(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally
kills Y, Z’s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and
the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the
provocation.
(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A.A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at
Y , neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight.
A kills Z. HereAhas not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.
(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by
the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing
done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.
(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a
word of A’s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by
these words, and kills Z. This is murder.
(e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays
hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in
consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing
done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage.A, a bystander, intending
to take advantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that
purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A
is guilty of murder.
Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good
faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by
law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence
without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for
the purpose of such defence.
Illustration.
Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A
draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other
means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed
murder, but only culpable homicide.
Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant
or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers
given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be
lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without
ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.
Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation
in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s
having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or
commits the first assault.
Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused,
being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own
consent.
Illustration.
A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of
Z’s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted
murder.
